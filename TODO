This is the list of things I would want to be done. I'll keep it as a personal 
reminder but also as an invitation for anyone interested.

* fetcher classes should have a superclass defining the whole interface 
* the daemon class can work as a chronjob or as a standalone daemon, implement
    such daemonization method.
* The backup method could be better implemented... maybe obtain a hash-prefix
    so new files are not overwritten
* It could be good if a database regarding the images is being compiled.
* setup.py could be smarter
* Maybe add a new method to initialize the daemon as a job (add init.d files
    and everything related to the OS).
